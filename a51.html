    <h3>  AN EVOLUTION OF FRAMES</h3>
    <p >
            
            
            Picture frames have traditionally been made of wood, which is still the most common material,
            Although other materials are used including silver, bronze, aluminum, and plastics such as polystyrene. 
            A picture frame may be of any color or texture, but gilding is common, especially on older wooden frames.

                 Some picture frames have elaborate molding which may relate to the subject matter.
            Complicated older frames are often made of moulded and gilded plaster over a plain wood base. 
            Picture frames come in a variety of profiles.

            Picture frames are generally square or rectangular, though circular and oval frames are not uncommon. 
            Frames in more unusual shapes such as football shapes, stars, hearts can be hand carved by a professional wood carver or carpenter (or possibly molded out of wood pulp). 
            There are also picture frames designed to go around corners. A popular design is the scoop, an indent in the frame adding depth.

                        The picture frame may contain a pane of picture framing glass or an acrylic glass substitute such as acrylite or plexiglas to protect the picture. 
                        In some instances where the art in the frame is dispensable or durable, no protection may be necessary. 
                    
                                  Glass is common over watercolors and other artwork on paper, but rare over oil paintings, except very valuable ones in some museums. 
                        Picture framing glass may be treated with anti-reflective coatings to make the glass virtually invisible under certain lighting conditions. 
                        When a picture frame is expected to be exposed to direct sunlight, or harsh lighting conditions such as fluorescent lights, UV filtering may be added to slow down the photocatalytic degradation of organic materials behind picture framing glass.

                        A fillet (also referred to as a slip) is a small piece of moulding which fits inside a larger frame or, typically, underneath or in between matting, 

                        The picture framing term is probably related to, though not necessarily derived from, the engineering term,
                        which it is frequently pronounced similarly to; however, unlike the use of fillets in mechanical engineering, the use of "fillets" in picture frames is wholly decorative.

                        Block mounting is a cheap alternative to framing. The technique (also known as display mounting, photo mounting or art mounting) involves sealing high quality photographic prints onto a wooden MDF board. 
                        The process of creating one is as follows:
            
                        The digital image or artwork is uploaded.
                        The block mounting company prints the image onto photographic paper with a finish (either matt or glossy).
                        The print is adhered securely onto an MDF wooden board with black edging, using a vacuum press and heat seal glue.
                        The image is laminated, packaged and delivered.

                                L Style frames are a simple variety that are constructed with a single L-shaped border of wood,
                                with the bottom part of the L, or rabbet, at the front of the frame to hold in the glass, object and backing, which are secured in from the back

                            photo cube is a special type of picture frame, often used to show members of a family, a vacation, or a timeline of someone's life.
                       
                            Other styles are clip frames (not really a frame at all), box frames and shadow boxes.
                            
                            A digital photo frame is an example of the changing technology of the 21st century.

                            Macaroni picture frames are a popular craft project for children. 
                            Uncooked pasta in various shapes are glued to a frame in a pattern. Sometimes the entire frame is painted.[7]
